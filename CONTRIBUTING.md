# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Code of Conduct

This is a project of the [Open Source Security Foundation](https://github.com/ossf/) and follows its [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Accepted Contributions

This repository is primarily for the OSV Schema definition([human-readable](docs/schema.md) and [JSON Schema](validation/schema.json)), and related tooling.

See the [guiding principles](GUIDING_PRINCIPLES.md) for background thinking behind the schema's design, and what is more and less likely to be acceptable in the way of changes.

For more substantial changes, we encourage you to open an issue for discussion and to also engage with the [OpenSSF Vulnerability Working Group](https://github.com/ossf/wg-vulnerability-disclosures/) about the proposed change.

## Code Reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
